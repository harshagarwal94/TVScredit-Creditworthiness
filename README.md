# TVScredit-Creditworthiness
This is a repository of my whole project, done in the final round of TVS CREDIT EPIC Season2. The model is calculating the credit worthiness of a potential small retailer if he/she will be able to repay the loan or not. 
Techniques used:- Front end, flask, ML, and other related skills. 
The link for all the files are uploaded and also the drive link is provided.
